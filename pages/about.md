Hello, my name is Sanchia and I am a student at Oxford Brookes Univeristy.

I have recenlty began a journey into Vegan eating. I was previously a peskitarian, however I wanted to explore the many vegan alternatives on offer as well as challenge myself to trying new foods. This journey has been difficult at times aswell as very rewarding both physically and mentally. I am constantly learning to love lots of diffrent foods and explore many diffrent cultures through vegan eating. 

This blog is a place to explore my favourite takeaway alternatives as this is soemhting that I found tricky to find good alternatives to! I also wanted to share differnt ways in which you can help the environment through taking a step back and looking at the imapct we have on our planet. 

I hope you enjoy my posts and see the fun that can be had with a vegan diet and lifetsyle!
