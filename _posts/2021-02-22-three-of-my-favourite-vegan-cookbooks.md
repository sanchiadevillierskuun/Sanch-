There are hundreds of books out there so I thought I would show you my top three favorite books to find fun quick and easy vegan meals: 



### *1. Deliciously Ella Quick & Easy: Plant-Based*

The new collection shows us that vegan cooking doesn't have to be difficult or time-consuming. The book is divided into sections including breakfasts, lunches, 10 minute and 20-minute meals, big-batch cooking, and weekend meals. Not only does this book show a huge range of diversity but also embraces a priority on well-being, self-care, and holistic dimension. 



### *2. Leon Fast Vegan*
