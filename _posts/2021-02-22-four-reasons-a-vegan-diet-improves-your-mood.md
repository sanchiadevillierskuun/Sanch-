Eating well is not just benefiting your gut..., it benefits your mind as well. Today's post is all about creating awareness of the positive effects that a vegan diet has on your mood. 

Here are four reasons why the transition to a plant-based diet is improving your mood:

***1. You might feel less depressed***

Nutritionist Geeta Sidhu-Robb (Founder of Nosh Detox) suggests that the elimination of fatty acids, predominantly arachidonic acid (more simply, the stuff found in meat and associated with symptoms of depression) means you are less likely to suffer from it. 

Alongside the elimination of fatty acids, a vegan diet also has more complex carbohydrates present which increases the feel-good hormone serotonin in the brain :)

***2. Your improved health can equal a better mood***

Eating vegan means consuming a higher level of vitamins and nutrients. These vitamins helo to combat illnesses and disease. Vitamin C helps boost the immune system and helps your body produce antibodies and fight off unwanted illnesses. Vitamin E is a powerful antioxidant that helps fight off infection.

All these additional vitamins you consume through a vegan diet means a lower chance of illness therefore a better mood all around! 

***3. A better quality of sleep***

Yes, that's right! Better sleep. Due to the increased consumption of vitamins like magnesium and calcium you will have a more regulated and effective sleep cycle. Magnesium helps improve sleep health whilst calcium helps aid a healthy sleep cycle. 

Eat avocadoes, pumpkin seeds, and spinach- these all contain high levels of magnesium.

***4. You may have decreased stress levels*** 

Vegan diets help to lower your blood pressure, cholesterol, and weight. This means you will physically be in better health. Geeta says how this can cause anxiety and stress levels to lower. Another way stress levels are lowered is through the additional consumption of vitamins.
