Mornings are not my thing, as I'm sure many of you relate to my struggle of getting out of a cozy warm bed. However, here are some ideas of how you could start your morning tomorrow:

## ***1. Podcasts or a book***

Podcasts or grabbing a book are two great way's to start your day. Taking 30 mins out of your day is really not going to set you back- I promise! It's about starting your day well ad letting your brain start to work. A great book I have been reading recently is Florence Given's "[Women Don't Owe You Pretty](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Women-Dont-Owe-You-Pretty/dp/1788402111)" Another great lockdown suggestion is the podcast called "The Girls Bathroom." 



## ***2. Matcha*** 

Yes- that green weird-looking drink actually is delicious! Matcha is a great way to start your day as it has a list of long benefits some including: 

* Promoting heart health, 
* Weight loss
* High in antioxidants
* Boosts brain function

Matcha is life-changing but I do recommend adding a little drop of vanilla or vegan-friendly sweetener to make your matcha latte even more tasteful.



## ***3. Mediation and/ or yoga***

Including some form of relaxation exercise or meditation practice in your daily routine is a great way to reduce stress and anxiety. Youtube is a great place to start if you're looking for some quick videos. 

Some of my favorite Youtubers on this topic include [Lottie Murphy, ](https://www.youtube.com/user/lifestylewithlottie)[Jessica Richburg, ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIXZNvQNioXFkc_Z-dfprrw)and [Yoga With Adriene. ](https://www.youtube.com/user/yogawithadriene)

Whether it's 5 minutes or 25 minutes this is a great way to clear your mind and start the day new. 



## ***4. A healthy breakfast***

Eating a healthy and well-balanced breakfast is one of the best ways to fuel and hydrate early on to create a consistent energy flow throughout the day. 

For breakfast, I would normally have a smoothie, avocado on toast, or oats with fresh fruit and a glass of pressed juice. Adding some chia seeds, nuts and other vegan-friendly extras to the fruit is a great way to start the day with lots of vitamins.
