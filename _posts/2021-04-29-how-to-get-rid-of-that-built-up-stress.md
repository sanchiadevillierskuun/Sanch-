This post differs in content however supports our theme of a happy, healthy lifestyle. This time of the year is particularly stressful for students let alone adding COVID into the mix. This is why I have shared some of my favorite techniques to relieve that built-up angst. 

1. Keep busy to distract yourself from the stress and craziness going through your mind. Try a new hobby, revisit your favorite workout, cook a nice dinner, and do things that make you feel good.
2. Give yourself 10 minutes each day for yourself, where you completely disconnect from your phone and work. It’ll help reset your mood for the day and prove to yourself that your mental health and well-being are a top priority in your life. Emails, calls, and texts can all wait for a short 10 minutes.
3.  A daily dose of fresh air always does the trick and helps clear the mind and keep you active. If you can’t find the energy for a walk, head to your garden and take deep breaths to help calm yourself.
4. Surround yourself with people who make you happy. Energy is contagious—positive and negative. Challenge yourself to be the one carrying positive energy.
5. Read through your favorite inspirational quotes. Start and end your day with words of wisdom that truly speak to you.

   I hope these help with your stress and remember it is only temporary stress!
