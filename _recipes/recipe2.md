*Ingredients:*


400g tin jackfruit
5 tbsp ready-made jerk barbecue marinade
¼ red cabbage, shredded
1 carrot, peeled and stripped with a peeler
2 spring onions, finely chopped
5 tbsp vegan mayonnaise
2 vegan burger buns or mini ciabattas, cut in half
squeeze fresh lime
1 tbsp chopped fresh coriander
salt and freshly ground black pepper

*Method:*

1. Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6.
2. Rinse and drain the jackfruit and put into a bowl. 
3. Use a fork to shred the pieces into strings. 
4. Add the jerk barbecue marinade and stir to coat.
5. Cover a baking tray with foil and brush with a little vegetable oil. 
6. Transfer the jackfruit on to the baking tray in a single layer and bake for 15–20 minutes, until the jackfruit has crisped up at the edges and is hot through.
7. Meanwhile, put the onion, cabbage and carrot in a bowl and mix with enough vegan mayonnaise to make a coleslaw. Season with salt and pepper.
8. Build your burgers with the slaw and barbecue jerk jackfruit and serve.
