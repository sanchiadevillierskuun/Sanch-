1 ¼ cups unsweetened plain almond milk (at room temperature)
2 tablespoons olive oil
3 tablespoons flour (spelt, rice, tapioca or all-purpose)
¼ – ½ cup nutritional yeast flakes
½ teaspoon garlic powder
¼ teaspoon chili powder
¼ teaspoon chipotle powder

Method:

Pasta: Cook your pasta according to package. Drain and place back in pot, set aside.

Vegan Cheese Sauce: 
In a small/medium saucepan, heat oil over medium heat, add flour and whisk to incorporate. 
Continue whisking and cook for 2 minutes, mixture will be bubbly. Add milk slowly, whisking constantly. Add the garlic powder, chili & chipotle powder and salt.
Turn heat to low and cook until sauce thickens, about 8 minutes, stirring frequently.
Remove from heat. 
Stir in nutritional yeast. 
Stir until everything is incorporated and smooth again. 
Taste for flavor.

Assemble: Add sauce and pasta together, tossing well, add more milk as needed and serve right away.
