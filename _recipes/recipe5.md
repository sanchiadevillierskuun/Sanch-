100ml vegetable stock

*For the pastry:*

225g plain flour
2 tsp sea salt
2 tbsp vegetable oil
2l vegetable oil to deep fry

*Method:*

STEP 1: The Filling

2. Add the vegetables, seasoning and stir well until coated. 
3. Add the stock, cover and simmer for 30 mins until cooked. 

   Leave to cool.

STEP 2: The Pastry

1. To make the pastry, mix flour and salt into a bowl. 
2. Make a well in the centre, add the oil and 100ml water to make a firm dough.
3.  Knead the dough on a floured surface for 5-10 mins until smooth and roll into a ball. 
4. Cover in cling film and set aside at room temperature for 30 mins.

STEP 3: Cutting

1. Divide the pastry into 12 equal pieces. 
2. Roll each piece into a ball and roll out into a circle of 15cm.
3.  Divide this circle into two equal pieces with a knife.

STEP 4: Filling

1. Brush each edge with a little water and form a cone shape around your fingers, sealing the dampened edge. 
2. Fill with 1 tbsp mixture and press the two dampened edges together to seal the top of the cone. 

   Repeat with the remaining pastry.

STEP 5: Cooking

1. Heat the oil in a large deep saucepan to 180C.
