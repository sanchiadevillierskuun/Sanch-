*Ingredients:*

For the veggies:


2 medium potatoes, cut into small, bite-sized pieces
4 cups mixed chopped vegetables (cauliflower, carrots, beans, bell peppers, corn, and peas all work well)

For the vegetarian korma sauce:

1 tablespoon oil
1 large onion, chopped
1 2-inch piece of ginger, peeled and chopped
4 garlic cloves, smashed with the back of a knife
1 5.5-ounce can of tomato paste
1 tablespoon each: curry powder and garam masala
1 1/2 teaspoons each: cumin, coriander, turmeric, cardamom
1â€“2 teaspoons sea salt

1/2 teaspoon each: ground cloves, fennel, fenugreek and chili flakes
1 400ml can of coconut milk
1/2 cup cashews
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1/2 cup yogurt (omit or use vegan yogurt for vegan)
1 tablespoon brown sugar (sub coconut sugar or honey for paleo)
Top with any or all: cashews, cilantro, lemon, and raisins

*Method:*

1. Add the potatoes to a medium-sized pot, cover with water and bring to a boil. 
2. Let the potatoes boil for 5 minutes then add the rest of the veggies to the pot. 
3. Let them boil for another 5 minutes then drain the pot and set it aside.
4. While the veggies are cooking, start preparing the vegetarian korma sauce. 
5. Heat the oil in a medium-sized pot over medium-high heat.
6. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until it is soft, about 5 minutes. 
7. Add the ginger and garlic and cook for 2 minutes more.
8. Remove the pot from the heat and add the tomato paste and all of the spices. Stir well then return the pot to the heat. 
9. When the spices are fragrant and the tomato paste caramelized, after about 1 minute, add the coconut milk, cashews, lemon juice and 1 1/4 cups of water.
10. Let the pot boil for 5 minutes to soften the cashews.
11. Working in batches, blend the curry until it is smooth then add it back to the pot. 
12. Stir through the yogurt and brown sugar and add more sea salt, if needed. 
13. Stir the veggies into the curry and serve immediately topped with any or all of the toppings.
